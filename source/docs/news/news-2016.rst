The ultimate explanation of optionSplit
---------------------------------------

So you think you really understand what the TypoScript
function does? Maybe, but better do a quick check:
What is the result of `wrap = a|*|r|||||||*|z`?


Is there something still missing?

Improved Theme: Now it's version 3.6.0
--------------------------------------

2016-06-30 by Martin Bless

`Several issues <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtd/commit/e22dd5d567165dbad817a983fcae1dabdc3efab2>`__
with the theme are fixed now. And the `README of the repository
<https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtd>`__
now has a pointer to the DEMO DOCS `t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs/>`__
which are kind of a "stresstest" for the theme and demonstrate what's possible.

New: A `.. rst-class:: panel panel-default` right before a section (headline) will give it a Twitter-Bootstrap
-like "panel" styling as you can see on this page with the latest news.

New: The theme is version 3.6.0 now. Get it the regular way from `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__
by doing:

`sudo pip install --upgrade t3SphinxThemeRtd`

Enjoy!
